# Crappy bird

A crappy verison of flappy bird with simple 2D graphics.

## Development

Use `cargo run` to run the development version.

## Production build

Use `cargo build` to build the production version. The production build needs the static assets folder in the same directory for sounds to work: `cp -r ./assets ./target/debug`.
